# React Native Template

This is a react native template for students at a high school because npx commands will not run for the students. 

After cloning, install dependencies in the project folder 

```
npm i
```

Then update the erie_setup.ps1 to your username instead of mine. Then copy and paste the commands from erie_setup.ps1 into the terminal.
